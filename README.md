## My process

I created my variables for colors and fonts. Then created the html and css. Next I did the mobile view before completing the desktop view. After all the views were created, I then created the javascript to fetch from the API. Finally , after completing the challenge goals, I checked my lighthouse score and made some edits to improve the performance.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about accessibility for buttons.
